# The empty Husky extras configuration has nothing in it and should not.
# It is meant to override the default to add custom control parameters
# file in your own Husky customization package and setting HUSKY_CONFIG_EXTRAS
# to your customization file in the launch fil control.launch.
# Each parameter will need to be loaded in the correct namespace to
# be used. For example, for a Husky with a lower gear ratio.
# This can be used to change husky_velocity_controller/wheel_radius_multiplier
# to account for the change in the gearbox.
